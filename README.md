## TODO
### Levels

### Features
* Event BeforeCollisionEnter (Before we update the velocity) in [ApplyGravityScript] ( på lådor i nuläget )
* Destructable Walls(needs all colliding objects velocity when landing, unaffected by player)
* Windows(needs all colliding objects velocity when landing, including player)

### Effects
* Player Animations - hard landing (needs player's speed when landing, use a landing animator trigger)

## BUGS
* Pop on rotate - solution lerp while rotation
* Jumping along side walls
* Jump skipping
* Weird falling speeds
* Getting stuck to certain parts of walls (unknown cause)
* Falling out of the world by glitching through the wall when there is a slight gap between the player and a falling block hitting them

## OTHER
* Customizable controls
